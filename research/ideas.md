# Ideas

General approach: for each $(P, S)$, **enumerate** all possible "rows" of $n = 6$ numbers with product $P$ and sum $S$, and then search through ways to **arrange** these rows/columns into a magic square.

## Enumeration

Enumerating all possible rows with product $P$ can be done in a reasonable amount of time. 

## Arrangement

* Find *semi-magic* squares first, because they have more symmetry, and then hope that with enough of them we can find one that is also magic (possibly after reordering rows/columns).
* Frame this as a subgraph isomorphism problem: let $R$ be the set of $(P, S)$-rows, and let $N$ be the set of numbers appearing in some rows in $R$. Construct a bipartite graph $G$ on vertex set $N\sqcup R$, with an edge $(n, r)$ if row $r$ contains $n$. Then we're looking for a subgraph of $G$ with $n^2$ $N$-vertices and $2n$ $r$-vertices with the correct edges.
  * The state of the art code for subgraph isomorphism is [Glasgow subgraph solver (2020)](https://github.com/ciaranm/glasgow-subgraph-solver) and [VF3 (2017)](https://github.com/MiviaLab/vf3lib)
